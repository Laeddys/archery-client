              LLSF is a sports club association whose activities are related to
              arc shooting sports.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              The only sport represented by the Federation is arc shooting, but
              it has different types of arc and different disciplines. The arc
              shooter can choose whether to specialize in the arc shooting
              Olympic discipline, participating in the SUV, or practicing the
              historic side of the archery.

            <Paragraph>
              It is best to start archery under the guidance of a coach or
              instructor in one of the sports clubs. Clubs usually have access
              to a beginner's inventory, so you don't have to buy it and you can
              assess whether the sport is a good fit for you and if there is a
              desire to continue doing it. The club will have the opportunity to
              get acquainted with different circuits and shooting disciplines
              and decide which one to specialize in.
